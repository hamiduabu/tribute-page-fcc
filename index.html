            <h3>Here's a brief timeline of her life:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Dr. Ameyo Stella Adadevoh was the lead physician at a private hospital in Lagos, when Nigeria had its first
                case of the ebola virus disease in July, 2014.</li>

              <li>She was born in Lagos in 1956 and qualified as a doctor in 1981.</li>

              <li>In 2012 Dr. Adadevoh was the first to alert the Nigerian Ministry of Health when the H1N1 Flu Virus (Swine
                Flu) spread to Nigeria.</li>

              <li>In 2014 She was the first to diagnose the Ebola virus disease brought into Nigeria by a foreign national who
                was to attend a conference in the country.</li>

              <li>Nigeria had never had an Ebola case before and was not yet prepared to contain an outbreak</li>

              <li>Even when threatened with a lawsuit, she resisted pressure from the patient's employers to allow him attend
                the conference he had come for</li>

              <li>Dr Adadevoh and her team exposed themselves to great risk as they cared for and attempted to contain the first
                case Ebola virus disease in Nigeria</li>

              <li>In August 2014, she tested positive to the virus and died about 2 weeks later</li>

              <li>In December, 2014, she was named &ldquo;Number 1 Humanitarian Everyone Should Know About (2014)&rdquo; by the
                International Medical Corps UK</li>

              <li>Also In December, 2014, she was named &ldquo;Leading Woman of 2014&rdquo; by CNN</li>
            </ul>
